# Computational Thinking in High School

> Computer Science Principles: What We Need in High Schools.

This project wants to be a critical analysis of the current situation
of computer science learning in high shcools in Italy. In the paper I
talk about the computational thinking and the importance of having a
course from the beginning of student's life that teaches how to think
as an informatics. Then I search for a solution analysing what
organizations around over the world has done until now in that sense
and I describe the course _Principi dell'Informatica_, the course
offered by _Programma il futuro_ for the high school students.
